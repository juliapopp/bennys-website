        <h3>
            <p>Benny was born in January 2017 and he seemed like a normal chihuahua puppy. He went to his home with Julia when he was 12 weeks old. Unfortunately, at about 8 months he started showing signs of neurological pain. After many expensive tests he was diagnosed with <a href="https://bvns.net/disease-conditions/coms/%22%3ECOMS</a>.</p>
            <p>Benny was promptly put on medication to control the pain in his head, with little effectiveness. Since medication was not helping much, he was referred to University of California: Davis for neurosurgery. This was about an 8 hour road trip for his mom from their home in Portland, Oregon, and he couldn't get on a plane due to the pressure changes. She and her sister made the drive without a second thought, and Benny went in for a suboccipital craniotomy in November, 2017.</p>
            <p>Shortly after his surgery was scheduled to start, his mom got a phone call from the doctors as she waited in her hotel room. They had stopped the surgery prior to making a single incision. They had noticed his heartrate spiking when they moved his head into position, a sign of immense pain despite the anesthetic. With his mom's permission they took live X-rays of his neck and head. They then discovered the true cause of his pain.</p>
            <p>Benny's C1 and C2 vertebrae were malformed, and when his head tipped down the bones pinched his spinal cord. Ouch! The doctors were glad to discover this, with this type of issue, had they pressed on with the initial surgery, he surely would not have survived. The next test was to see if stabilizing his neck would relieve his pain. The doctors made him a neck brace out of a small styrofoam cup, gauze, and self-adhesive bandages.</p>
            <p>For the next four months, Benny wore his fancy new neck brace, getting fresh bandages every few weeks, with his mom using different colored bandages to keep him festive for the holidays. This helped him immensely. Without being able to tilt his head down his vertebrae were unable to pinch his spinal cord. With this being effective, he was scheduled for a new surgery in California. Another 8 hour road trip, and he was ready for atlantoaxial fusion surgery, locking his vertebrae in place permanently.</p>
